# Data analysis projects

These are a few projects I've done with data analysis, data visualization, text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning.

## Notebooks

**Presentation - NLP in Python**

Python; Notebook from a 45-minute presentation to students and faculty in the Python Data Club at UI, teaching them how to do NLP in Python.

**Predicting Income From Census Data**

Python; Used NBP and US Census data to try to classify whether an individual's income was great. Built classificatin models with logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k nearest neighbors, and naive Bayes. Best predicted income achieved with quandratic discriminant analysis. Most important variable was the amount of capital gains, and work class, marital status, and age.


**Predicting Salaries from Job Postings**

Python; Used NLP to predict the salary of job postings from UK job posting boards. Postings had variables including job title, raw text job description, raw location, contract/not, posting source, job category, and the company. Accuracy was measured in root mean squared error (RMSE), i.e. average residual from predicted salary. Built models with linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, quandratic discriminant analysis, k nearest neighbors, and naive Bayes Lowest RMSE was with quandratic discriminant analysis model with SourceName, Category, and ContractTime.

**Romney_Python_viz_DSCOMP18.html**

Python; Basic data visualization of live performances at theater venues in the US over the last thirty years. The data viz component of the Data Science Comp at UI 2018. A quick and dirty analysis.
